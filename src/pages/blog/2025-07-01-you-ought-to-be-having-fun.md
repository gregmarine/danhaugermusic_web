I have had the opportunity to play in quite a few cover bands, jazz groups, symphonic ensembles, and various other musical genres that allow the sound of the trumpet to grace their timbre.

Playing my trumpet is something that I love to do.  It is a passion of mine, and there are times when I make a dollar or two from playing.  However, the band that I have learned the most about being a trumpet player, band member, and horn section leader was with the group Henle and the Loops.  

I have learned a lot from many of the groups that I have played with in Florida, but I feel that I have learned more about honing my skills while playing in the Sunshine State rather than lifelong skills and depth of music I had learned while I was in Henle.

When I started playing trumpet in Henle, many of the songs we played sounded familiar to me, but I didn’t know many of the titles or original artists.  For example, I had heard tunes like “What is Hip, “You’re Still a Young Man”, and “Diggin’ on James Brown,” but never knew that they were performed by the group Tower of Power.  I know, I know, what rock was I living under, but that was one of my big flaws in my early music life.  I didn’t know the history or background of the tunes or the groups.  I was just wiggling my fingers on my trumpet valves and playing high notes.

Now, I make sure I know about the artists of the tunes I am playing and some of their other works.  Knowing their other tunes may help stylistically when playing their other pieces.

One of Tower Of Power’s tunes that is a blast to listen to and play is “You Ought To Be Having Fun.”

Some of the lyrics are:

You ought to be having fun

Put your troubles on the run

Makin’ someone happy

It’ll make you feel so glad

Obviously, those are not all of the lyrics, but they hit a few of the points that I am discussing in this month's blog.

I have fun when I play my trumpet.  

I have fun when I am performing.

I have fun when I am on stage, making music, and helping people forget about life for a while.

Therefore, I am having fun, putting my troubles on the run, and making someone happy.

It does make me feel glad.

I have mentioned Ken Strieby many times, and I am sure I will mention him many more times throughout my life.  The last time I had the opportunity to hang out with Ken, he showed me the score and solo part to Maynard’s “Danny Boy.”  After our score study and mutual admiration of Maynard’s ability to soar in the stratosphere in one measure and then glissando down into the basement notes of the trumpet two measures later, Ken looked at me and said, “Isn’t this fun?”

Ken knew how to have fun with music.  If you watched him conduct, play, and emcee, you could tell that he enjoyed entertaining.

Recently, I have seen videos of a guy playing trumpet next to himself.  He pays a duet using split screen, but he does it so well that it looks like he is really sitting next to someone.  The version of himself on the left-hand side of the screen plays the tune in a “legit” style, and the right side plays the tune in a “lead, screaming, and a lip-trilling/ kissing off style of playing.”  Needless to say, I really enjoy the videos.  The left side version of himself appears annoyed and almost disgusted with the right side version, and it is hilarious.  

The guy’s name is Mike Capozzi.  If you haven’t found him yet, I recommend that you look him up and follow him.  

He is having fun!

The only problem is, internet trolls coupled with the attitude of “real” trumpet players make comments that attempt to bash his intonation and ability.  I have stated in a few of my blog posts that real trumpet players should never participate in that type of behavior.  Mr. Capozzi made a video addressing the trolls and explained that he is just having fun. 

It is sad to me that he felt that he needed to address the trolls.  His message kindly reminded the trolls that he was having fun and making people smile.  

Bravo, sir, keep up the good work.

Originally, I was going to title this month’s blog “Be Like Mike.”  I decided on “You Ought To Be Having Fun” because I felt that it encompassed the spirit of the writing and the fun of playing music.
