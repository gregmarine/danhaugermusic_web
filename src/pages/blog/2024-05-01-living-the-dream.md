What does, “Living the Dream” mean?

Really?

Does it mean that once you have attained your dream, your goal, or what you have always aspired to be, you are finished and will be comfortable riding off into the sunset?

Just like many cliches or mottos in life, it has a different meaning for everyone.

My wife and I have recently had a conversation about our dreams and how will we pursue and attain them.

By the way, I am talking about goals, aspirations, and achievements.  This is not going to be a blog about how I interpret my dreams.  I rarely dream when I sleep and if I did have a dream, it would probably be about me running along train tracks that lead into the Gulf of Mexico while playing Chattanooga Choo-Choo on my trumpet.  

Those are completely different kinds of dreams and different aspirations.

My living the dream, dream, while in high school was to be a studio trumpet player.  I wanted to live in New York or LA and be a recording artist.  I never had the desire to be a headliner or the need to see my name in lights.  My dream was to work in the studio and then play gigs when I was not in the studio.

My dreams changed a bit while I was in college.  I considered concentrating all of my trumpet technique and education on “legit studies” so I could get my chops ready for orchestra auditions.  The only problem was that my trumpet professor, Dr. Dalvin Boone, was educating me in the ways of trumpet which far exceeded my expectations and dreams.  I needed to learn as much about trumpet playing and varying techniques in order to be a good trumpet player anyway, and he knew it and was providing me the education and opportunities.

Throughout the years I have had many trumpet-playing dreams.  I have also fulfilled and plan on fulfilling more dreams.  Playing in the group Henle and the Loops was definitely a dream come true.  It was also as if I was in a dream while playing in that group.  I played some great music, with great friends, for a great cause.  I played music by Tower of Power, Chicago, Earth Wind and Fire, and so many other great horn band charts.  I was truly living a dream.  Stupid COVID hit and everything got shut down a few days before a gig.  Soon after everything started running again, I retired from the fire department and moved to Florida.  Honestly, if I had the funds, I would fly up and play with Henle for gigs.  That is how much of a dream it was playing with the Loopsters.

Now that I am retired and living in Florida, I plan on honing my trumpet-playing abilities to be a solid utility player and dreaming up more dreams.  

One of the retirement/Florida dreams I have is to play for Disney.  I auditioned for the Walt Disney World Candlelight Processional last year and realized, after talking to a friend and an incredible trumpet player, that I should have auditioned with a different piece of music.  I plan on auditioning again this year while playing the piece he suggested.  

A dream that I originally had, before retirement, was to play in the Main Street Philharmonic at WDW.  That dream has changed from a dream into, “It would be a blast to do”.   Besides, living a little over 2 hours away from Disney would make playing every day at WDW a difficult daily commute.  Therefore, driving up a couple of days for a performance is very doable while fulfilling a dream.  In my mind, anyway.

We will see if the dream becomes a reality.  If it does then I have an issue with the whole notoriety thing I mentioned earlier.  I don’t have the desire to be a headliner or see my name in lights, but I am concerned if my desire to play for Disney is more of an ego/bragging right, “thing”.

I am not the stereotypical trumpet player.  When meeting other trumpet players, I do not shake their hands and say, “Hi, I’m better than you.”  I don’t think that in order for me to screw in a light bulb I stand in place, hold the bulb into the air, and let the world revolve around me.  Instead, I am the type of musician who tries to learn from, encourage, and get along with other musicians.  Sure there may be times when I am trading 2s or 4s with someone there will be a bit of oneupmanship, but that is for show and nothing personal.

If I do meet someone that shakes my hand and greets me with the, “Hi, I’m better than you attitude.”  I will generally smile, warm up quietly, and then wait to see if they are all talk or if I will need to wear a back brace because I will be carrying their weight part way through the gig because they had worn out at the end of the first set.  Fortunately, I have only encountered a couple of trumpet players with that type of attitude and that was a very long time ago.

I believe that is why it feels like I am living part of my dream every time I play my trumpet.  I play gigs with other trumpet players that are solid musicians, great people, and incredible mentors.  They strive to be better, they push others to be better, and they encourage young musicians to be positive members of the music community.

Living a dream doesn’t always mean beating great odds, achieving goals unattainable by others, or struggling for a long time until the big break comes.  Living a dream can and is most fulfilling when you are thankful that you are able to share a talent and skill you have worked on for countless hours with others.  Living a dream can be satisfying when you become an encouragement to others through the music you share with them.  Living a dream can be fulfilling when you are content to play your music in all situations, and circumstances, and for all who will listen.

Live the dreams as they present themselves to you.  Don’t waste your time pursuing one huge dream when you can enjoy many dreams that wait to be enjoyed through music.
