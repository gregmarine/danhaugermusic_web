One of my favorite movies, ever, is “Joe versus the Volcano”.  I believe that I mentioned it in a previous blog.  I had also mentioned and used a painting that my daughter made for me of Joe sitting on luggage, playing a ukulele, while floating in the ocean.  For this blog, I decided to use one of the promo pictures of the movie, just in case you wanted to look it up.  You can search for it by the image.

Recently, I have written two letters of recommendation.  One for admission into a school of music for a former student and the other for a job application for a friend.  I enjoy bragging about others.  When I brag about them, in person, I become very animated and begin to list their attributes to whoever is interested.  The best part is, everything I say about them is the truth, and I think they deserve to receive the bragging.

My problem with writing letters of recommendation is that what if my writing, phrasing, or description of the person doesn’t paint a complete picture?  What if I write in a way that doesn’t sell them to the inquiring entity?  What if their worthiness for the spot or position is judged by how well they are seen through the letter of recommendation I have submitted?

Going back to Joe versus the Volcano.  One of my favorite scenes, which happens a couple of times, is when Joe walks into work and Mr. Waturi, his boss, is on the phone.  You can only hear his side of the conversation, but you know exactly what is being said on the other side.

WATURI

Yeah, Harry, but can he do the job? 

I know he can get the job, but can he do the job?
I'm not arguing that with you.
I'm not arguing that with you.
I'm not arguing that with you

Mr. Waturi waves absently at Joe and goes on talking into the phone.

WATURI

Who told you that?\
No. 

I told you that.\
Me.\
What?
Maybe. 
Maybe.\
Maybe.

I do not question the abilities of the two who requested the letters of recommendation.  Unlike Mr. Waturi, I know they can do the job.  The only issue is whether they can get the job or the spot?  

Many times, positions are made known to the public due to legalities.  The position or positions will be filled internally, but the company is required to post the jobs to the public.  

Would the student be an asset to the college music department?  

Absolutely and without a doubt!

Will they give him a chance to show them how incredible a human being he is?  I certainly hope they do.  They would be foolish not to bring him into that school of music.

For my friend, I had to fill out a questionnaire/form/mark the appropriate boxes/ and write some things about the person applying in the space provided.  I didn’t write a letter of recommendation; I was a reference, colleague, friend, or someone who could attest to their ability to function in society and do the job for which they had applied.  But what I really wanted them to see was how amazing and professional my friend is!

I am not saying that their future hinges on the few words I wrote; however, is there a chance that a person in HR, hiring, or admissions may toss out the letter or questionnaire because a few “buzz words” were not included?  I witnessed people not receiving higher rankings on a fire department hiring list because they did not say the words that the people conducting the interview had in their little check boxes.  The people on the panel didn’t watch the person to see how well they were handling the pressure of being interviewed.  They didn’t pay attention to their body language to see if they were answering the question earnestly or just regurgitating buzz words they were instructed to say.

A lot of well-qualified people are looked over or set to the side because they did not fulfill the requirement of spewing forth the blather that the people interviewing them wanted to hear, so that they could color in a square and make their check mark on the paper.

Again, I have to pull back on my own reins to keep myself from becoming negative.

Again, I need to step back and realize that I am not as important as I think I am at times.  My words of recommendation are not world-changing.

Again, I remind myself that my two friends will excel, succeed, and propel themselves into the world with or without my words.

“Hey, wait a minute,” you may be thinking, “This is supposed to be a music blog.  Not a blog of you confessing that you sometimes think that you are more important than you really are!”

Great observation!

Although humility is a noble trait, how can one be humble and yet get noticed in the music world?

Navigating my way through my work schedule, moving to a new area, and wanting to get connected in the music scene has been a little daunting.

How can I “sell myself” so that I will get calls for jobs when I am not sure who is buying the product?

A friend had informed me of a few bands that may have openings for another trumpet player, but I haven’t had the opportunity to follow through with inquiring about the openings until now.  I hope that doesn't sound like me making excuses, but I think it does.

Hopefully, my schedule will line up with rehearsals and gigs so that I can “get the job.”  I already know that I can do the job, but can I get the job?

I need to set a practice schedule and make sure I can play the full range I am capable of playing on my horn, as well as continue to work on my lip flexibility and volume control.  If I get the job and know that I can do the job, I have to be able to keep the job.

Mardi Gras time is approaching at Universal Studios, and I plan on auditioning for a trumpet spot with a small group that travels around, plays, and helps people enjoy their time in the park.

We will see if I get to fulfill a dream of playing in at least one theme park.  If not, I will keep practicing and striving for the times I can help people forget about the stress of the world for a while through music.
