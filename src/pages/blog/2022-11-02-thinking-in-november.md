The month of November is known for Thanksgiving, giving thanks, and being thankful.  

Personally, November also makes me “Think-ful”.  In plain English, I am full of thoughts and memories during this time of year.

In October’s post, I mentioned that I played the Haydn Trumpet Concerto during my senior year of high school.  I began practicing the Haydn in November 1987 in preparation for the Solo and Ensemble contest.  If I received a first division at the Solo and Ensemble contest, I would advance to State Solo and Ensemble contest where I would play the solo memorized.

Picture this now, little cubby-cheeked Dan, holding his Mercedes II trumpet, his MF3 Jettone mouthpiece, and the Haydn trumpet concerto in his hand, ready to play for the judge.  

When it was my time to play, I walked into the room, handed the judge the piano part, placed my music on the music stand, nodded to the piano player to receive my tuning note, and tuned (I remember I was a little sharp and made the adjustment), nodded to the piano player to start, and turned to the music.

I noticed the music stand was too low for my taste so I gripped my trumpet between my knees, reached on either side of the stand, and pulled up.

That was when Jaye P Morgon decided to stand up and give me the loudest gong in The Gong Show history.  Well, that is what it sounded and felt like.  What really happened was…The top of the stand pulled away from the base and conked me on the bridge of my nose.  

I replaced the stand head onto the base, lifted it slowly and without my face hovering over it, picked up my music, and began playing the beginning of the first movement.

At that time, the judge stood up while waving his hand and said, “Son, stop.  You need to go get that cleaned up.”

I had no idea that blood was streaming down my face while the music of Haydn was filling the room from an MF3 Jettone-clad Mercedes II trumpet.

My dad and band director, Mr. David Marcotte, stood up, ushered me out of the room, and took me into the bathroom.  They leaned me over the sink and began to splash water on my face.  To this day, I have no idea where they got a bandaid, but, after they dried my face, they slapped the bandaid across the gap on the bridge of my nose (I still have the scar as proof).

I went back to the room where I was to perform my solo and after waiting for the next soloist to finish, I went inside, played, and received my first-division rating.

To say I am thankful for my dad, my band director, and the judge would be an understatement.  I am thankful not only for their quick response but, thankful for not giving me the option to not play my solo after the stand-pulling incident.  They knew I wanted to play, needed to play, and would not walk away without playing the Haydn Trumpet Concerto.

When I stood in front of the judge at the state solo and ensemble contest, I played the first two phrases very well, then my mind went blank.  I couldn’t remember the next section, phrase, or note of the piece and the Haydn trumpet concerto suddenly turned into the “Dan Hauger contemporary piece inspired by works of Haydn.”

I am thankful the judge didn’t know what had happened to me at the first contest and I am thankful the judge gave me a third division at the state solo and ensemble contest.  I deserved nothing better than a third division and maybe even a fourth.

On the morning of October 8, 2016, my dad passed away.  My brother and I had been staying with my dad as his health deteriorated.  My brother called me in the early morning of October 8th and informed me of dad’s passing.  We spent the day finalizing the arrangements for his viewing and funeral as well as comforting one another.

That night I was scheduled to play a gig with Henle and the Loops, henleandtheloops.com .  My wife and I had talked and she encouraged me to go play the gig.  She knew I needed to play my horn and be with the members of Henle.  You see, Henle and the Loops played shows to help raise money for charities.  We never received personal payment and it was the best rock/funk group I have ever played.

I showed up to the gig, completed the sound check, and then called my wife then brother to see how they were doing.  After thanking my wife for understanding and encouraging me to play the gig, she responded, “You don’t have to thank me, I knew you needed to play.”

After the first set, I called home again and checked on my wife.  I let her know I was doing well, and the gig was incredible as always.  

“Everything alright, Dan-o”, I heard from Chuck, the band leader, after hanging up with my wife.

“Yup,” I replied, “But, I need to tell you something but you have to promise not to send me home.”

He laughed and said, “Okay, I won’t send you home.”

I had told him about my Dad’s passing that morning and how I waited until after the first set to tell him because I was afraid he would have told me not to come or send me home if I had told him earlier.  

“You’re right,” he said, “I would have told you not to come.  But, I understand that you need to be here and play.  Thanks for being here and I am sorry for your loss.”

I am thankful to my wife and to Dr. Charles Carter, Henle’s band leader, for understanding that I needed to play my trumpet.  They understood that playing my horn was my way of honoring my dad.  I was thankful that my dad patched up my nose and walked me back to the room to play my solo in 1987 and I was thankful that I was able to play my trumpet, raising funds for a charity, in honor of my dad on his day of passing.  Therefore, I become think-ful during this month of being thankful.  I think of the experiences I have been blessed to have throughout my life that have helped me become the person and trumpet player I have become.

By the way, whenever I raise a music stand, I stand to the side and pull with straight arms.  I am thankful I learned a valuable lesson that kept me safe, over 35 years ago.

Stay safe,
Dan
